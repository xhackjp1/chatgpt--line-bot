## Usage

## Scaling

### AWS Lambda

By default, AWS Lambda limits the total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 100. The default limit is a safety limit that protects you from costs due to potential runaway or recursive functions during initial development and testing. To increase this limit above the default, follow the steps in [To request a limit increase for concurrent executions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html#increase-concurrent-executions-limit).

### Redis

In the provider section of the serverless.yml file, you can specify the VPC and subnet to be used for deploying the Lambda function. For example, you can write it like the following:

```
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs16.x
  vpc:
    securityGroupIds:
      - sg-xxxxxxxxxx
    subnetIds:
      - subnet-xxxxxxxxxx
      - subnet-yyyyyyyyyy
```
